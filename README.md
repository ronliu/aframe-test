Learning the basics of A-Frame by following along with A-Frame School and the documentation.

What I learned:
- basic file organization for A-Frame (assets, components folders)
- using the asset management system (<a-assets>) for better performance (asset preloading and caching)
- reconstructing primitives (boxes, spheres, cylinders) using entity-component architecture (<a-entity>)
- modifying elements and handling events with JavaScript and DOM APIs
- using community-made components from the A-Frame Registry for animation, particle systems, and event-setting
- adding gaze-based cursor interactions with <a-camera> and <a-cursor>
