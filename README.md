Learning the basics of A-Frame by following along with A-Frame School and the documentation.

What I learned:
- basic file organization for A-Frame (assets, components folders)
- using the asset management system (&lt;a-assets&gt;) for better performance (asset preloading and caching)
- reconstructing primitives (boxes, spheres, cylinders) using entity-component architecture (&lt;a-entity&gt;)
- modifying elements and handling events with JavaScript and DOM APIs
- using community-made components from the A-Frame Registry for animation, particle systems, and event-setting
- adding gaze-based cursor interactions with &lt;a-camera&gt; and &lt;a-cursor&gt;
- declaring explicit character encoding in files (e.g. the angle brackets used in the bullet points above)
